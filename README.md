# EmoTV
As the name suggests, EmoTv is capable of interacting with a person and determine his current mood. Running on python coded lines, it can efficiently involve in a conversation with a subject. Our TV features playing songs alongside the emotion recognition part. As an added bonus, it shows up a cartoonized image of yours with your name written on bottom right of screen and displays your emotion. We have also added image magick gui alongside the cartoonized image for further editing of the image. The entire project is completely based on python scripts, displaying the vastness of the language. Our project covers topics ranging from machine learning using Tensorflow to Speech recognition and conversion. Our EmoTV Project is a step towards making robots understand human emotion, thus lessening the gap of human machine interaction.
